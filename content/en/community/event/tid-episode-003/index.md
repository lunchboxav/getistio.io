In episode 3, we will talk about how to set up SSL certificates in your Istio ingress gateway. Weâ€™ll show you how to use self-signed certificates (and why you should never do this) and how to automate certificate management.

Demo script for all scenarios is [here](https://github.com/tetratelabs/istio-weekly/blob/main/episodes/003/demo.md).
